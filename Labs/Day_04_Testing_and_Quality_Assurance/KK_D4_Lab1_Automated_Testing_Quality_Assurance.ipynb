    "You are an expert QA Engineer specializing in pytest and FastAPI testing. Your task is to generate comprehensive \"happy path\" test functions for a FastAPI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context - Application Code:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "Generate a pytest test file with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Structure:**\n",
    "   - Use pytest best practices with clear, descriptive test function names following the pattern `test_<operation>_<expected_outcome>`\n",
    "   - Include proper imports: `pytest`, `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`, and import the `app` from `app.main`\n",
    "   - Create a module-level TestClient instance: `client = TestClient(app)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Required Happy Path Tests:**\n",
    "   a) **Test POST /users/** - Create a new user successfully:\n",
    "      - Send a valid user payload with all required fields (first_name, last_name, email, role_id, start_date)\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 201 (Created)\n",
    "      - Assert the response contains the created user data with a user_id\n",

    "      - Use a unique email address (e.g., with timestamp or UUID) to avoid conflicts\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) **Test GET /users/** - List all users:\n",
    "      - Send a GET request to retrieve all users\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 200 (OK)\n",
    "      - Assert the response is a list (can be empty or contain users)\n",

    "      - Assert the retrieved user data matches the created user data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Practices to Follow:**\n",
    "   - Each test should be independent and not rely on specific database state\n",
    "   - Use descriptive variable names\n",
    "   - Add docstrings to each test function explaining what it tests\n",
    "   - Use proper assertions with clear failure messages\n",
    "   - Clean up any test data if necessary (though fixtures will handle this later)\n",
    "   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in each test\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Format:**\n",
    "   - Provide only valid Python code for the test file\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text outside the code\n",
    "   - Include a module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test file\n",

    "   - Include proper imports: `pytest`, `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`, and import the `app` from `app.main`\n",
    "   - Create a module-level TestClient instance: `client = TestClient(app)`\n",

    "   a) **Test POST /users/ with duplicate email** - Verify duplicate email handling:\n",

    "\n",
    "   b) **Test GET /users/{{user_id}} with non-existent ID** - Verify 404 handling:\n",
    "      - Send a GET request for a user_id that doesn't exist (e.g., 999999)\n",

    "   - Include clear assertion messages that help diagnose failures\n",

    "   - For tests that create data first, ensure they use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Format:**\n",
    "   - Provide only valid Python code for the test file\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text outside the code\n",
    "   - Include a comprehensive module-level docstring\n",

    "### Challenge 3 (Advanced): Testing with an Isolated Database Fixture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Generate a `pytest` fixture that creates a fresh, isolated, in-memory database for each test session. Then, refactor your tests to use this fixture. This is a critical pattern for professional-grade testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint:** Why use an isolated database? Running tests against your actual development database can lead to data corruption and flaky, unreliable tests. A pytest fixture that creates a fresh, in-memory database for each test ensures that your tests are independent, repeatable, and have no side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Create a prompt that asks the LLM to generate a `pytest` fixture.\n",
    "2.  This fixture should configure a temporary, in-memory SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "3.  It needs to create all the database tables before the test runs and tear them down afterward.\n",
    "4.  Crucially, it must override the `get_db` dependency in your FastAPI app to use this temporary database during tests.\n",
    "5.  Save the generated fixture code to a special file named `tests/conftest.py`.\n",
    "6.  Finally, create a new test file, `tests/test_main_with_fixture.py`, and ask the LLM to rewrite the happy-path tests from Challenge 1 to use the new database fixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** Two new files, `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/test_main_with_fixture.py`, containing a professional `pytest` fixture for database isolation and tests that are correctly refactored to use it."

    "# TODO: Write a prompt to generate the pytest fixture for an isolated test database.\n",
    "db_fixture_prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "You are an expert QA Engineer specializing in pytest fixtures and FastAPI testing with database isolation. Your task is to generate a professional-grade pytest fixture for database testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context - Application Code:**\n",
    "{app_code}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "Generate a `conftest.py` file for pytest with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Purpose:**\n",
    "   - This file should contain pytest fixtures that will be automatically discovered and used by all test files\n",
    "   - Include a comprehensive module-level docstring explaining that this provides shared fixtures for database isolation\n",
    "   - The fixture must create an isolated, in-memory SQLite database for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Required Imports:**\n",
    "   - Import necessary modules: `pytest`, `sqlalchemy` components, `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`\n",
    "   - Import the FastAPI `app`, database models (`Base`), and the `get_db` dependency from `app.main`\n",
    "   - Import any other necessary SQLAlchemy components for database creation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Fixture Requirements:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   a) **Create a `test_db` fixture** with the following characteristics:\n",
    "      - Use `@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")` to create a fresh database for each test function\n",
    "      - Create an in-memory SQLite database using `sqlite:///:memory:`\n",
    "      - Use SQLAlchemy to create a new engine with proper configuration\n",
    "      - Create all database tables using `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`\n",
    "      - Create a SessionLocal for the test database\n",
    "      - Yield a database session to the test\n",
    "      - After the test completes, properly close the session and drop all tables using `Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)`\n",
    "      - Include error handling to ensure cleanup happens even if tests fail\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) **Create a `client` fixture** that:\n",
    "      - Depends on the `test_db` fixture (use `test_db` as a parameter)\n",
    "      - Overrides the FastAPI app's `get_db` dependency to use the test database instead of the production database\n",
    "      - Uses `app.dependency_overrides[get_db]` to replace the dependency\n",
    "      - Returns a `TestClient(app)` instance for making API requests\n",
    "      - After the test completes, clears the dependency override with `app.dependency_overrides.clear()`\n",
    "      - Properly handles setup and teardown\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices to Follow:**\n",
    "   - Use proper fixture scopes (`function` scope ensures test isolation)\n",
    "   - Include try-finally blocks to ensure cleanup happens\n",
    "   - Add comprehensive docstrings to each fixture explaining its purpose and usage\n",
    "   - Ensure the fixture properly yields control to tests\n",
    "   - Make sure database sessions are properly closed\n",
    "   - Guarantee that each test starts with a clean, empty database\n",
    "   - Use the `yield` keyword correctly for setup/teardown patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Critical Implementation Details:**\n",
    "   - The `test_db` fixture must create a function that returns the test database session\n",
    "   - This function should be passed to `app.dependency_overrides[get_db]` in the client fixture\n",
    "   - Ensure compatibility with the existing `get_db` dependency pattern in the main application\n",
    "   - The fixture should handle SQLAlchemy session management properly\n",
    "   - Include proper error handling for database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Format:**\n",
    "   - Provide only valid Python code for the conftest.py file\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text outside the code\n",

    "You are an expert QA Engineer specializing in pytest and FastAPI testing. Your task is to refactor existing happy path tests to use a pytest fixture for database isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context - Application Code:**\n",
    "{app_code}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "Generate a refactored pytest test file with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Purpose:**\n",
    "   - This file contains the same happy path tests from Challenge 1, but refactored to use the database fixture from conftest.py\n",
    "   - Include a module-level docstring explaining that these are happy path tests using isolated database fixtures\n",
    "   - Tests should NOT create their own TestClient - they will use the fixture instead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Structure:**\n",
    "   - Use pytest best practices with clear, descriptive test function names following the pattern `test_<operation>_<expected_outcome>`\n",
    "   - Include proper imports: `pytest`, and import models/schemas if needed for type checking\n",
    "   - **DO NOT create a module-level TestClient** - instead, each test function should accept a `client` parameter\n",
    "   - The `client` parameter will automatically receive the fixture from conftest.py\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Required Happy Path Tests (Refactored):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) **Test POST /users/** - Create a new user successfully:\n",
    "      - Function signature: `def test_create_user_success(client):`\n",
    "      - Accept `client` as a fixture parameter (pytest will inject it automatically)\n",
    "      - Send a valid user payload with all required fields (first_name, last_name, email, role_id, start_date)\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 201 (Created)\n",
    "      - Assert the response contains the created user data with a user_id\n",
    "      - Assert all input fields match the response fields\n",
    "      - Use a unique email address to ensure test isolation\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) **Test GET /users/** - List all users:\n",
    "      - Function signature: `def test_list_users_success(client):`\n",
    "      - Accept `client` as a fixture parameter\n",
    "      - First, create one or two test users via POST to ensure the database has data\n",
    "      - Then send a GET request to retrieve all users\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 200 (OK)\n",
    "      - Assert the response is a list containing the created users\n",
    "      - Verify each user has the required fields (user_id, first_name, last_name, email, role_id, start_date)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) **Test GET /users/{{user_id}}** - Get a specific user:\n",
    "      - Function signature: `def test_get_user_by_id_success(client):`\n",
    "      - Accept `client` as a fixture parameter\n",
    "      - First create a user via POST /users/\n",
    "      - Extract the user_id from the response\n",
    "      - Then retrieve that user by their user_id\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 200 (OK)\n",
    "      - Assert the retrieved user data matches the created user data\n",
    "\n",
    "   d) **Test PUT /users/{{user_id}}** - Replace/update an entire user:\n",
    "      - Function signature: `def test_update_user_success(client):`\n",
    "      - Accept `client` as a fixture parameter\n",
    "      - First create a user\n",
    "      - Then send a PUT request with completely new data for all fields\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 200 (OK)\n",
    "      - Assert all fields are updated to the new values\n",
    "\n",
    "   e) **Test DELETE /users/{{user_id}}** - Delete a user:\n",
    "      - Function signature: `def test_delete_user_success(client):`\n",
    "      - Accept `client` as a fixture parameter\n",
    "      - First create a user\n",
    "      - Then send a DELETE request for that user_id\n",
    "      - Assert the response status code is 204 (No Content)\n",
    "      - Verify the user is actually deleted by trying to GET it (should return 404)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Differences from Original Tests:**\n",
    "   - Each test function MUST accept `client` as a parameter (this is the fixture injection)\n",
    "   - NO module-level `client = TestClient(app)` - the fixture handles this\n",
    "   - Tests can assume they start with a completely empty, fresh database\n",
    "   - Tests don't need to worry about existing data or conflicts (except within the same test)\n",
    "   - Each test runs in isolation with its own database\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best Practices to Follow:**\n",
    "   - Each test is independent and starts with a clean database (thanks to the fixture)\n",
    "   - Use descriptive variable names\n",
    "   - Add docstrings to each test function explaining what it tests\n",
    "   - Use proper assertions with clear failure messages\n",
    "   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern\n",
    "   - For tests that need data, create it at the start of the test\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Format:**\n",
    "   - Provide only valid Python code for the test file\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text outside the code\n",
    "   - Include a module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test file\n",
    "   - Ensure the code is properly formatted and follows PEP 8 style guidelines\n",
