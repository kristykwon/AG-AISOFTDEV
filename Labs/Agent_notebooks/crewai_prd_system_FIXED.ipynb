Executive Summary & Vision\\nThe Onboarding Management System is designed to streamline the onboarding process for new hires, managers, and HR administrators. By providing a structured checklist, relevant contacts, and progress tracking, the system aims to enhance the onboarding experience, reduce repetitive queries, and ensure timely integration of new employees. The ultimate vision is to create a seamless and efficient onboarding journey that fosters engagement and productivity from day one.\\n\\n## 2. The Problem\\n\\n**2.1. Problem Statement:**\\nNew hires currently face a fragmented and overwhelming onboarding experience, leading to decreased initial productivity and a high volume of repetitive questions to HR and managers.\\n\\n**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**\\n\\n- **Persona 1: The New Hire**\\n  - Scenario: A new hire is overwhelmed by the lack of clear guidance and struggles to find the right contacts for queries, resulting in delayed onboarding progress.\\n\\n- **Persona 2: The Manager**\\n  - Scenario: A manager is unable to effectively track the onboarding progress of new hires, leading to missed opportunities for timely intervention and support.\\n\\n- **Persona 3: The HR Administrator**\\n  - Scenario: An HR administrator finds it challenging to customize onboarding tasks for different roles, resulting in irrelevant tasks being assigned to new hires.\\n\\n## 3. Goals & Success Metrics\\n\\n| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| Improve New Hire Efficiency | Reduce time-to-first-contribution | Decrease by 20% in Q1 |\\n| Reduce Support Load | Decrease repetitive questions to HR | 30% reduction in support tickets |\\n| Increase Engagement | Onboarding completion rate | Achieve 95% completion rate |\\n\\n## 4.

The onboarding tool is a lightweight application intended for internal use, primarily to streamline the process of integrating new employees into the organization. Key considerations included:\\n\\n- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: The tool needs to be straightforward to set up and maintain, with minimal administrative overhead.\\n- **Development Speed**: The project has a tight timeline, necessitating a database that allows for rapid development and iteration.\\n- **Deployment Environment**: The tool will be deployed in environments where a full-fledged database server may not be available or necessary.\\n- **Data Volume and Concurrency**: The expected data volume is relatively low, and the application will have a limited number of concurrent users.\\n- **Cost**: Budget constraints favor solutions that do not incur additional licensing or operational costs.\\n\\n## Decision\\nUse SQLite as the primary database for the onboarding tool.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n### Positive Implications\\n- **Simplicity**: SQLite is a serverless, self-contained database engine that is easy to set up and use, reducing the complexity of the deployment process.\\n- **Rapid Development**: With its minimal configuration requirements, SQLite allows developers to quickly set up the database and focus on application logic.\\n- **Low Overhead**: As a lightweight database, SQLite requires minimal resources, making it suitable for environments with limited infrastructure.\\n- **Cost-Effective**: SQLite is open-source and free to use, aligning with budget constraints.\\n- **Portability**: The entire database is stored in a single file, making it easy to move and back up.\\n\\n### Negative Implications\\n- **Scalability**: SQLite may not handle high concurrency or large datasets as efficiently as other database systems like PostgreSQL or cloud-based solutions.\\n- **Limited Features**: Advanced database features such as stored procedures, triggers, and full-text search are limited compared to more robust systems.\\n- **Concurrent Access**: While suitable for low to moderate concurrency, SQLite may become a bottleneck if the number of concurrent users significantly increases.\\n- **Integration**: If future requirements necessitate integration with other systems or databases, transitioning from SQLite to a more scalable solution may require additional effort.\\n\\nOverall, the decision to use SQLite balances the project's current requirements with its constraints, providing a pragmatic solution that supports rapid development and deployment within the given context.\\n\\nWORKFLOW_COMPLETE\", 'name': 'TechnicalArchitect', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'APPROVED: ADR 001: Database Technology Selection', 'name': 'QualityReviewer', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Coordinator'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Coordinator'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Coordinator'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Coordinator'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Coordinator'}], summary='', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}}, human_input=[])"
