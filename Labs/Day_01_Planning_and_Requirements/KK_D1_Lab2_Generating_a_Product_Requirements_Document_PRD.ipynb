In this lab, you will use an LLM to synthesize the detailed user stories into this formal document.\n",

      "WelcomePath is a centralized, digital onboarding platform designed to streamline the new hire experience from the moment an offer is accepted. We are building it to solve the problem of fragmented, manual, and inconsistent onboarding processes that create anxiety for new hires and administrative burdens for managers and HR. The vision for WelcomePath is to become the single source of truth for onboarding, fostering a welcoming and engaging environment that accelerates new hire productivity and integration into the company culture.\n",

      "**2.1. Problem Statement:**\n",
      "New hires currently face a disconnected and paper-heavy onboarding process, leading to first-day anxiety, reduced initial productivity, and significant administrative overhead for managers and HR teams. This lack of a centralized system results in inconsistent experiences across departments and missed opportunities to engage new employees effectively from the moment they accept their offer.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Persona 1: Alex Chen, The Anxious New Hire**\n",
      "    - **Scenario:** Alex has just accepted a job offer. He receives multiple emails with different PDF forms to print, sign, scan, and email back. He isn't sure who is on his team and feels disconnected, leading to anxiety about his first day. He wants a clear, single place to see what he needs to do and to learn about his new colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 2: Sarah Rodriguez, The Busy Hiring Manager**\n",
      "    - **Scenario:** Sarah is excited to have a new person joining her team, but she is swamped with her own project deadlines. She struggles to remember all the onboarding tasks she's responsible for, like scheduling introductory meetings and ensuring equipment is ordered. She has no easy way to track her new hire's progress without sending multiple \"just checking in\" emails.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Persona 3: David Miller, The Process-Driven HR Administrator**\n",
      "    - **Scenario:** David is responsible for ensuring every new hire gets a consistent, compliant onboarding experience. He manually creates and emails different task checklists for different roles (e.g., Engineer vs. Sales). When a company policy changes, he has to update several different document templates and hopes managers use the most recent version.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Prompt the LLM to generate a Pydantic model that reflects the structure of the `prd_template.md`. The model should have fields for each major section (e.g., `introduction: str`, `user_personas: List[str]`, `user_stories: List[Dict]`).\n",
    "2.  Save this generated model code to a file named `app/validation_models/prd_model.py`.\n",
    "3.  While we won't write the full validation script in this lab, generating the Pydantic model itself is the key advanced step. It creates a reusable, code-based standard for our documentation.\n",
