**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-30T14:00:00Z

## Models Used
- **claude-sonnet-4.5**
  - Used for code generation, prompt engineering, and integration tasks.
  - Provided Python code for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic models.
  - Assisted in troubleshooting schema mismatches and generating test scenarios.

## Lab Notebook Reference
- Lab notebook: Labs/Day_03_Development_and_Coding/KK_D3_Lab1_AI_Driven_Backend_Development.ipynb

## Key Learnings
- Always align ORM models and Pydantic schemas with the actual database schema.
- Use automated scripts and test suites to validate changes.
- Document every step for reproducibility and future reference.
- Prompt engineering is critical for getting accurate code from LLMs.
- Back up code and database before making structural changes.

## Notes
- The claude-sonnet-4.5 model was instrumental in generating boilerplate code and providing integration guidance.
- Timestamp reflects when the model was actively used for this project.
